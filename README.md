This website is designed to express affection between individuals. It features a straightforward layout consisting of two buttons positioned centrally, accompanied by a gif display. The "Yes" button functions to expand in size with each successive click, while the "No" button iterates through various text iterations upon each click. This cycling continues until the "Yes" button occupies the entire screen, symbolizing a completion of the affectionate exchange.
